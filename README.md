The web app Uniform Zone is created to bridge the gap between Schools and School Uniform Vendors for common people. Here the Schools can add themselves and list their products according to their requirement from the admin panel.
Additionally, Customers can visit the website, visit the school whose Uniform they would want to purchase and thereby buy products according to their requirement from the School Unform Vendors itself without actually visiting them.
Also, the requests are made 50% faster than pre-release.
